**THIS IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE!!! Come back in a few days to see what the final blog page looks like.**

**WARNING: This posts contains information on a game about body inflation fetish content. It is highly recommanded to NOT read this if you aren't above 18, or at the minimum, above 13.**

This is my first post, so you might find a couple errors lol.

Alright, so recently, I tried modding a GameMaker Studio 2 game called "[Wii Fit Trainer Inflation Mini-game](https://blunder-jub.itch.io/wii-fit-trainer-inflation-minigame)". The game was made by Blunder Jub. Why did I try modding this game? I honestly wanted to add it to Flashpoint, since they support HTML5 games, and also because this is the ONLY game that Blunder Jub made that is exclusivly for browsers, so it needed proper archiving.

In early October, I tried downloading the game and running the HTML5 page as a local file, but the game didn't work. However, when uploading and running the game through GitHub Pages, it seemingly worked. So my goal was now to get it running offline, but I quickly gave up, but recently, I got Flashpoint Core 11, and I tried running it through there, and it worked!!! So now the game kinda works offline, but why isn't it running as a standalone local file (with the rest of the assets of course)?

Turns out Flashpoint uses a special local server to create a "fake internet". This server starts up in the same time as when you start up the launcher. I might miss some details, so here is a page on how Flashpoint works, on a surface level: [https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/How_Flashpoint_Works](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/datahub/How_Flashpoint_Works).

I am too lazy to figure out how to make a local server, and I'm fine with using Flashpoint.

Anyways, the game runs offline/on a local machine, and the files can now be edited. This blog page serves as a way to document the spritesheet included in the game, as well as how to modify it, using a template I recently made. I do not want to go into details on the full timeline of all the attempts I made to make a proper template, but I am going to explain to you how to use it.

## The files (and programs) you're gonna need
Unfortunatly, this tutorial is only for Windows **for now**
- [Flashpoint Core](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/) (any version that play curations)
- The files for the Wii Fit Trainer Inflation Mini-game.
- The Spritesheet Template thing (idk how to call it)
- [paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) (to open and edit the template spritesheet thing)
A pack with the files for the game and the template can be downloaded [here](https://adaaaaaaadsasd.github.io/assets/wftimg/wftimg.zip). There is also files for
If you want to use another program to edit the spritesheet which supports layers, a pack with the template spritesheet as individual PNGs can be downloaded [here](https://adaaaaaaadsasd.github.io/assets/wftimg/template.zip). Make sure that this program supports making images without antialiasing.
## Understanding the spritesheet
So in the template there are 3 layers. Layer "1", well, is the top layer, but also what you see in normal gameplay. Layer 2 is what I call "**the template**". This is the layer that will guide you for editing the "recommanded sprites". There is also layer 3, which can guide you to edit the rest of the used sprites.

Also, there is actually a good amount of unused "sprites" in the sheet.

Here is what a spritesheet with Layers 1 and 2 looks like:

## Loading the game in Flashpoint Core/Extracting the game
- If you haven't done it yet, install Flashpoint Core, paint.NET, and download the files for the game.
1. Open Flashpoint Core
2. Go to the "Curate" tab
3. Click on "Load Archive
4. Select the `wftimg.zip` archive (the game files)
5. You now have the files loaded into Flashpoint Core

## Opening and editing the spritesheet (if you are doing it with paint.NET)
1. Assuming you have the game loaded into Flashpoint Core, click the "Open Folder" button at the end of the Curation.
2. In the Windows File Explorer, from the game folder, navigate to `content\localflash\4240742-Custom\html5game`
3. Load `WFTBodyInflationMinigame_texture_template.pdn` in paint.NET
4. After that you are done editing the spritesheet, hide layers 2 and 3.
5. If you got any layer over layer 1, merge them down to layer 1.
6. Save the file as `WFTBodyInflationMinigame_texture_template.png`.

### Opening and editing the spritesheet (with alternative programs)
1. Extract `template.zip`
2. Open "`1.png`, `2.png`, `3.png`", and place them in numerical order (from 1 to 3) as layers.
3. After that you are done editing the spritesheet, hide layers 2 and 3.
4. If you got any layer over layer 1, merge them down to layer 1.
5. Save the file as `WFTBodyInflationMinigame_texture_template.png`.

### Tips for editing the spritesheet
- If you are planning to use the Paint Bucket to change the colors in the spritesheet, make sure that Antialiasing is set to Disabled.
- When replacing the normal head with your new, custom head (if you're planning to do that), make sure that the head is at the same "position" as the head already present in the spritesheet. I recommand placing your new head in a separate layer, then copying it with the valid position to the head with eyes closed.

## Testing your edited spritesheet
1. Assuming you have the game loaded into Flashpoint Core, go to the Additional Applications section of the curation.
2. Click the "Run" button below the Application called "Template".
3. Enjoy the game.

### Running the game normally, or with the included examples
- To run the game normally, click the "Run" button at the end of the page.
- To run the included examples, click the "Run" button below the Application/Example you want to select, in the Additional Applications section.

## Epilogue
You now know how to modify Blunder Jub's Wii Fit Trainer Inflation Mini-game to have custom character, and how to run it offline. Thank you for reading.

### Bonus: Information on the examples
I was literally just going through deviantart when I found some characters by bo-the-sno (The artist which made the artwork in the original game).
I selected 3 of characters, with my goal being of making them playable:
- Veronica from [[CM] EDM Festival 2](https://www.deviantart.com/bo-the-sno/art/CM-EDM-Festival-2-866517884)
- The goth from [Sizing Up](https://www.deviantart.com/bo-the-sno/art/Sizing-Up-798058676)
- Alleigha from [[CM] Bar Balloon](https://www.deviantart.com/bo-the-sno/art/CM-Bar-Balloon-794324531)
I really like the results for Veronica and Alleigha, but however, I think that the head in the Goth mod is a bit too much at the right.
#### Bonus bonus: A few images from the development of the mods
Here is an image from when I loaded a custom spritesheet for the first time. Note that I didn't have the template with multiple layers back then.
