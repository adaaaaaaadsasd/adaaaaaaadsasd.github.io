Very very final post. Also, it's my birthday tomorrow (the 30th of May).

I was back in business the last few months, making a very few updates to inflatable suitz!, and making a few scripts that would help me making games. I also talked alot with friends I made here the past months.

However, everything must come to an end. I set myself May 29th as some sort of "timebomb" for my whole inflation roblox game maker carrier thing. I think that it was pretty fun (especially because it made me around 4k robux, and I still make some in small quantities every week). Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.

Well... after a small discussion with one of my friends who is one of the two contributors for inflatable suitz!, he told me that he got exposed for all of that inflation stuff he made, and recently, I've seen that ROBLOX deleted a LOT of inflation models (ROBLOX W, personally). I think that "Inflation", should not exist at all publicly on ROBLOX, just kept private, like what I did with my game for the past 6 months. No one knows that it happened. And I prevented the consequences of getting "fed" inflation stuff at a young age for a LOT of people. For an odd reason, kids these days love weird shit, including being fat??? A VERY good example of this phenomena is with YouTube Kids, see all the weird shit there is in there? To return to my main topic, I prevented a bunch of kids from playing an inflation game at a young age. That shit fucks up your brain bro, especially at a young age. You learn about sexual behaviour AND you learn about it in a weird and unusual, "fantastic" (not in the good way), that the majority would hate.

Anyways, that "ROBLOX banning inflation models" situation gave me an idea for a surprise for you guys.

YUP! I downloaded fucking **289 MODELS** from the ROBLOX Library/Toolbox. There is also a few Local Places included, and another surprise I worked hard on the past 7 days...

**OpenSuitz!**

Yes, a "new" project. Well not exactly. It's just an improved "Open Source", version of the Weather Balloon Suit in inflatable suitz!, except it has a few new features. You only need to insert the model inside of your game, or just to open the included demo game!

[Download](/assets/download/archive_finalrelease.7z) (43MB zipped, 133MB unzipped)

You'll need 7zip to extract the 7z file. There is NO password this time. There are a few more informations in the READ ME, and more "a rambling about why inflation on roblox should not be public".

Goodbye.

P.S. Again, I won't delete this repository and the Discord server. I won't come back this time too.

Also, there is some weird shit in the archive too. Like even if you think that inflation isn't weird, there's even weirder things that were made with inflation that I included in the archive, for the sake of preservation.
