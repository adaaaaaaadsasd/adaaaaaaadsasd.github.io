**WARNING: This contains information only for Android devices. Sorry iOS users.**

Y'all thought that I was dead or something? Nope! I only partially quitted the inflation fetish scene. "Partially", because I still look through inflation art on DeviantArt. Anyways, I came accross pictures of A.I. art and blah blah blah now I make A.I. art using UniDream. Sadly, UniDream isn't avaliable on computers (it would've been easy to crack it).

UniDream normally forces you to pay 6,49 CAD per month, or 25,99 CAD per year (you get a discount if you buy it per year, but the service might be down in a few years, plus you get the extra cards if you cancel and get the subscription back at the end of the month.) for you to remove watermarks (they put watermarks because they want you to buy Pro to pay for their dumb servers who probably have thousands of pre-generated pictures), but I found a way to extract the original images, which don't have the watermarks.

## Prerequisites
Unfortunatly, this tutorial is only for Android **for now** (and possibly only Samsung devices too). I do not have a device with iOS on it at the moment (nor do I plan to get one, fuck Apple).
- [UniDream](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hugelettuce.art.generator) (obviously)
- An app that can view (and possibly move) hidden files. The standard "My Files" app that comes with your device should do it (google how to enable it, since it isn't enabled by default).

## The tutorial
1. Open your File Explorer app thing, and navigate to your Internal Storage (or your SD card if you moved UniDream there.)
2. Navigate to `(storage)\Android\data\com.hugelettuce.art.generator\files\AppInnerFiles\.works\project\aiDream`. (note: if you don't see the `.works` folder, you haven't turned on the setting to show Hidden Files.)
3. You now have alot of folders infront of you. Each of them is one of your pieces of generated art. If you open one, you're gonna see 3 files, a `json`, a `png`. and a `webp`. The `json` contains all of the information about your art: the used prompts, the art style, and the aspect ratio. the `webp` is just a slightly compressed version of the `png`, and the `png` is the real treasure. It's the original image without the watermark!

## Epilogue
You now know how to get your UniDream creations without watermarks for free. Thank you for reading.
