**WARNING: This posts contains information on a game about body inflation fetish content. It is highly recommanded to NOT read this if you aren't above 18, or at the minimum, above 13.**

Second post let's go ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

Alright, so if you do not know, I am the creator of a Roblox game called "inflatable suitz!". Yes, I know that it is against the Roblox TOS to make a game about sexual content (Roblox and probably most people consider inflation as sexual content), but I already have a sweet community based around it (that I do not want to break).

The game is some times described as a "revolution" in the Roblox *normal* inflation community (for some odd af reason, there are more "high quality" furry inflation games than normal inflation games on Roblox), since it's one of the first Roblox inflation games to use a combo of decent meshes (those meshes were made by Tef77) and decent scripting. This game is also the first new inflation game for a while, perhaps for 2022 (I have been in the community since 8 months ago, and I do not remember any game from that era). It also doesn't use any of the regular inflation free models you see every where.

Anyways, I am making this blog post to announce the new plugin I made, which will probably greatly help me make characters/morphs for the game. I decided to make it public to make it so more people can make their own characters, and perhaps submit them.

## The files you're gonna need
Unfortunatly, this tutorial is only for Computers **for now** (you never know, Roblox might make Roblox Studio for mobile or some shit)
- [inflatable suitz! Character Creator V1](https://adaaaaaaadsasd.github.io/assets/fwoompsuitz/suitzCC.rbxmx)
- [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create) (kinda obvious lmao)

You might also want a plugin to "insert" a model of a player you want to "convert" to the game's format. I strongly recommand Load Character Lite by AlreadyPro. This plugin is avaliable [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/752585459/Load-Character-Lite).

## Installing the plugin
1. Open a place in Roblox Studio (I recommand an empty place)
2. Go to the "Plugins" tab
3. Click on "Plugins Folder"
4. Drag and drop `suitzCC.rbxmx`
5. You now have the plugin installed

### Opening the plugin
1. Go to the "Plugins" tab if you went to another tab
2. Click on `Character Creator by adaaaaaaadsasd`

## Understanding the plugin UI

You will probably understand the plugin UI as soon as you see it. Just a small specification tho: you need to place the base model for you character in Workspace or else it won't work.<br>Oh, and if the plugin doesn't detect a CharacterSelection UI not being present in game.StarterGui, it will automatically put one there (this UI is what is being used to test out the morph.).<br>I also recommand **ALWAYS** checking the "Parent to game.ServerStorage.Characters" box. (you will need to put a baseplate with the size being `2048, 12, 2048` and the position being `0, -1028, 0` for less bugs tho.)<br>You might also want to run the game with avatars in R6 for the animations to work.

Here is a quick example of the plugin in action:

## Testing your morph
1. Click the "Play" Button or press F5 to start the game.
2. Enjoy playing around with your inflated character.

## Epilogue
You now know to use the tool I just developed for my own game. Feel free to make your own characters!

I am also planning support for the male body (which i haven't developed due to time constain.) You might want to come back in a few days to see an update to the plugin/ a separate plugin for male bodies.

#### Bonus: A small bit of info about the progress of inflatable suitz! V7
The game is kind of ready for a release (i honestly do not know how i managed to complete the rest of the update in 1 week, i thought it would take me a bit more time)

**WARNING!: This video showcases most of the update lmao. (also the portal mechanic is pretty buggy and manages to break the physics)**
