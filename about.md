retired roblox game developer, i've made weird ToS breaking stuff on there. quitted because of updates (example: the removal of r6) and also because of I wanted to stop developing those ToS breaking games

this is pretty much my alt account where i go crazy about borderline nsfw stuff.

i've also made a bunch of art using AI (specifically: UniDream) in the past. i'm not very proud of that art so i have removed them from my deviantart page. i'm not against archiving tho, so you can download them [here]()

i do not have much else to say.

if you want to contact me, here is my Discord: adaaaaaaadsasd (if you do not want to send me a Friend Request, i am in the Flashpoint server if you want to send me a DM instead)
