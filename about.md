I am a retired roblox game developer, which has knowledge on LuaU as well as Roblox Studio in general. I quitted because of updates and also because of my game, which was fetish related (I wanted to stop)

I also recently started to make A.I. Art using UniDream, and posted it on DeviantArt.

I do not have much else to say.

If you want to contact me, here is my Discord: adaaaaaaadsasd#2746

and here's my DeviantArt: [https://www.deviantart.com/adaaaaaaadsasd](https://www.deviantart.com/adaaaaaaadsasd)
